1.1. Determine which side of their pivot each suffix falls on (requires inspecting return values from binary search).
Do this separately for maximal matches and all suffixes --- you need both sets of information.

1.2. Sort all maximal matches. Their ranks will allow you to order suffixes in O(1) time.

2.1 Use maximal matches to enumerate all suffixes. As you do so, use pivot information determined earlier (1.1) to
place them in the appropriate part of the final file. You will need buffering obviously. After this go and sort
each bucket with the order data structure obtained in 1.2.
